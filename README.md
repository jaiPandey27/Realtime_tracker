### Project Description

**Real-Time Tracking App**

This real-time tracking application leverages modern web technologies to provide a dynamic, interactive map experience. The core stack includes Node.js, Express, Socket.IO, Leaflet, MongoDB, and EJS, enabling seamless integration of server-side logic, real-time communication, and intuitive client-side mapping.

**Key Features:**

1. **User Authentication**: Ensures secure access and personalized user experience.
2. **Real-Time Location Updates**: Uses Socket.IO to transmit geolocation data, enabling real-time tracking of users.
3. **Interactive Map**: Leaflet.js provides a responsive map interface where user locations are marked and updated dynamically.
4. **Database Integration**: MongoDB stores user data and location history, enhancing the app's functionality and user experience.
5. **Responsive UI**: EJS templates render the HTML, allowing for a dynamic and responsive user interface.

**How It Works:**

- **Client-Side**: The browser fetches the user's geolocation and transmits it to the server using Socket.IO. Locations are displayed on a Leaflet map, with markers for each user, which update in real-time as users move.
  
- **Server-Side**: The Node.js server handles incoming connections, broadcasts location updates to all connected clients, and manages user disconnections to ensure accurate map representation.

This project showcases the powerful synergy of real-time web technologies, offering a robust platform for tracking applications, logistics management, and more.
